About

   [edit]

   Root Insurance headquarters are in Columbus, Ohio. Root is focused on
   embedded insurance and expanding their embedded insurance offerings
   acquiring customers through strategic partnerships. Root Insurance
   largest markets are Texas, Georgia, and Colorado, where approximately
   35% of customers for the year ended December 31, 2022 reside. ^[2] As

   million in cash and cash equivalents. ^[3]

History

   [edit]

   Root Insurance was founded in March 2015 by Alex Timm and Dan Manges.

   In 2021, Manges co-founder retired as CTO but remained a consultant to
   the company through December 2021. In August 2021, Root announced a
   partnership deal with Carvana to develop personalized auto insurance
   for Carvana's car-buying platform. This was Root Insurance's first
   embedded partner.

   The deal, initially formed around a $126 million investment by Carvana
   for a 5% stake in Root, includes warrants that can be exercised at
   certain stages or tranches. The collaboration uses both companies
   technologies to develop an embedded experience for customers purchasing
   a car with Carvana.^[4]

   In January 2022, Root closed on a $300 million five-year term loan with
   BlackRock. The maturity of this term loan is January 27, 2027.^[5] On
   March 23, 2023, Root Insurance Chief Revenue and Operating Officer,
   Daniel Rosenthal resigned, having started as a director for Root
   Insurance in 2017.^[6]

   Root's share price is less than one seventh of its IPO price.

Sponsorships

   [edit]

   In December 2020, 23XI Racing announced that Root will be one of the
   sponsors of the No. 23 Toyota Camry driven by Bubba Wallace. As of
   January 2023, Root is no longer sponsoring 23XI Racing or Bubba
   Wallace.^[7]^[8] In 2023, Root sponsored Dreyer & Reinbold Racing and
   Ryan Hunter-Reay in the 2023 Indianapolis 500.^[9] For 2024, Root
   signed a multi-race sponsorship deal with Chip Ganassi Racing to
   sponsor both Álex Palou and Marcus Armstrong in the IndyCar
   Series.^[10]
