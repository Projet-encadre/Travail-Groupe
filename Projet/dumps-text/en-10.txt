   root

   / ro̅o̅t,rt /
    1. A plant part that usually grows underground, secures the plant in
       place, absorbs minerals and water, and stores food manufactured by
       leaves and other plant parts. Roots grow in a root system. Eudicots
       and magnoliids have a central, longer, and larger taproot with many
       narrower lateral roots branching off, while monocots have a mass of
       threadlike fibrous roots , which are roughly the same length and
       remain close to the surface of the soil. In vascular plants, roots
       usually consist of a central cylinder of vascular tissue,
       surrounded by the pericycle and endodermis, then a thick layer of
       cortex, and finally an outer epidermis or (in woody plants)
       periderm. Only finer roots (known as feeder roots) actively take up
       water and minerals, generally in the uppermost meter of soil. These
       roots absorb minerals primarily through small epidermal structures
       known as root hairs. In certain plants, adventitious roots grow out
       from the stem above ground as aerial roots or prop roots, bending
       down into the soil, to facilitate the exchange of gases or increase
       support. Certain plants (such as the carrot and beet) have fleshy
       storage roots with abundant parenchyma in their vascular tissues.
    2. See also fibrous root
    3. Any of various other plant parts that grow underground, especially
       an underground stem such as a corm, rhizome, or tuber.
    4. The part of a tooth that is embedded in the jaw and not covered by
       enamel.
    5. Mathematics.
         1. A number that, when multiplied by itself a given number of
            times, produces a specified number. For example, since 2 × 2 ×
            2 × 2 = 16, 2 is a fourth root of 16.
         2. A solution to an equation. For example, a root of the equation
            x ^2 − 4 = 0 is 2, since 2 ^2 − 4 = 0.

   root
   ^1
    1. The part of a tooth below the gum. The root anchors the tooth to
       the jawbone.

   root
   ^2
    1. In biology , the part of a plant that grows downward and holds the
       plant in place, absorbs water and minerals from the soil , and
       often stores food. The main root of a plant is called the primary
       root; others are called secondary roots. The hard tip is called the
       root cap, which protects the growing cells behind it. Root hairs
       increase the root's absorbing surface.
