Production

   [edit]

   Buzo was approached to make the film by Alan Burke. "He approached me
   to do this for what I felt were all the right reasons," said Buzo. "I
   thought he would do it with style and flair, rather than being
   pedestrian and naturalistic. But I didn't breathe my sigh of relief
   with Rooted until I saw the final version."^[3]

   The film was set in Manly in the mid-sixties. According to Buzo, "I've
   been told Rooted hasn't dated, but with a telemovie it has got to have
   a more definite time and place."^[3]

   Buzo said making a telemovie was tough. "It is so silent, it is like
   swimming underwater. When I saw the rough cut I was a bit shocked
   because the film medium seems unsubstantial compared to the stage... I
   think the stage is more malleable; if something doesn't work you can
   change it immediately. If something doesn't work on television you just
   can't go back and change it."^[3]

   Buzo was happy with the end product. "If all television could turn out
   like this I would be very happy because if it bad been done badly it
   would have reflected on the play. If it is good, it's like having
   something embalmed, like having 'St Rooted'."^[3]

   The film remained stylised. "I hate the naturalism of all these
   mini-series," said Buzo. "It is so boring. I prefer things to be like
   Rooted, more quirky, like a black comedy."^[3]

Reception

   [edit]

   The Age's Jason Romney calls it "a perculiar mix of domestic drama,
   black comedy and social satire" and says "Although too long, Rooted is
   nonetheless a merciless examination of the social centrifuge that can
   send a man to the "outer"."^[4]
