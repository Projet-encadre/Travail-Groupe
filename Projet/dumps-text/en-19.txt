TikTok pleads its case against sell-or-ban law before Supreme Court
       A lawyer for TikTok argued before the Supreme Court on Friday that
       a ban on the social network would violate TikTok's and Americans'
       First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court this morning heard
       arguments on whether to overturn or delay a law that could
       effectively ban TikTok​ in the U.S. The bill, officially titled the
       Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications
       Act, gives TikTok parent company ByteDance until January 19, 2025
       to divest its U.S. operations or face a ban
