Root Directory

   The root directory, or root folder, is the top-level directory of a
   file system. The directory structure can be visually represented as an
   upside-down tree, so the term "root" represents the top level. All
   other directories within a volume are "branches" or subdirectories of
   the root directory.

   While all file systems have a root directory, it may be labeled
   differently depending on the operating system. For example, in Windows,
   the default root directory is C:\. On Unix systems and in OS X, the
   root directory is typically labeled simply / (a single forward slash).
   As you move up directories within a file system, you will eventually
   reach the root directory.

Website Root Directory

   The root directory of a website is not the top-level directory of the
   volume, but rather the top-level directory of the website folder. On an
   Apache server, for example, the name of the root directory is
   public_html and is located within primary user folder for the website.
   Therefore, the root folder of a website can be accessed using a single
   forward slash. For example, a link to a file called home.html within
   the root directory of a website can be accessed using the reference
   "/home.html."
