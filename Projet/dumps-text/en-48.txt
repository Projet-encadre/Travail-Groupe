   ROOT is an object-oriented computer program and library developed by
   CERN. It was originally designed for particle physics data analysis and
   contains several features specific to the field, but it is also used in
   other applications such as astronomy and data mining. The latest minor
   release is 6.32, as of 2024-05-26.^[3]

Description

   [edit]

   CERN maintained the CERN Program Library written in FORTRAN for many
   years. Its development and maintenance were discontinued in 2003 in
   favour of ROOT, which is written in the C++ programming language. ROOT
   development was initiated by René Brun and Fons Rademakers in 1994.
   Some parts are published under the GNU Lesser General Public License
   (LGPL) and others are based on GNU General Public License (GPL)
   software, and are thus also published under the terms of the GPL. It
   provides platform independent access to a computer's graphics subsystem
   and operating system using abstract layers. Parts of the abstract
   platform are: a graphical user interface and a GUI builder, container
   classes, reflection, a C++ script and command line interpreter (CINT in
   version 5, cling in version 6), object serialization and persistence.

   The packages provided by ROOT include those for
     * Histogramming and graphing to view and analyze distributions and
       functions,
     * curve fitting (regression analysis) and minimization of
       functionals,
     * statistics tools used for data analysis,
     * matrix algebra,
     * four-vector computations, as used in high energy physics,
     * standard mathematical functions,
     * multivariate data analysis, e.g. using neural networks,
     * image manipulation, used, for instance, to analyze astronomical
       pictures,
     * access to distributed data (in the context of the Grid),
     * distributed computing, to parallelize data analyses,
     * persistence and serialization of objects, which can cope with
       changes in class definitions of persistent data,
     * access to databases,
     * 3D visualizations (geometry),
     * creating files in various graphics formats, like PDF, PostScript,
       PNG, SVG, LaTeX, etc.
     * interfacing Python code in both directions,
     * interfacing Monte Carlo event generators.

   [220px-Atlas_ROOT_plot.png] The ATLAS experiments presented on 4 July
   2012 the status of the Standard Model Higgs search. All the plots
   presented that day were created in ROOT.

   A key feature of ROOT is a data container called tree, with its
   substructures branches and leaves. A tree can be seen as a sliding
   window to the raw data, as stored in a file. Data from the next entry
   in the file can be retrieved by advancing the index in the tree. This
   avoids memory allocation problems associated with object creation, and
   allows the tree to act as a lightweight container while handling
   buffering invisibly.

   ROOT is designed for high computing efficiency, as it is required to
   process data from the Large Hadron Collider's experiments estimated at
   several petabytes per year. As of 2009^[update] ROOT is mainly used in
   data analysis and data acquisition in particle physics (high energy
   physics) experiments, and most current^[update] experimental plots and
   results in those subfields are obtained using ROOT.

   The inclusion of a C++ interpreter (CINT until version 5.34, Cling from
   version 6.00) makes this package very versatile as it can be used in
   interactive, scripted and compiled modes in a manner similar to
   commercial products like MATLAB.

   On July 4, 2012 the ATLAS and CMS LHC's experiments presented the
   status of the Standard Model Higgs search. All data plotting presented
   that day used ROOT.

Applications

   [edit]

   Several particle physics collaborations have written software based on
   ROOT, often in favor of using more generic solutions (e.g. using ROOT
   containers instead of STL).

Criticisms

   [edit]

   Criticisms of ROOT include its difficulty for beginners, as well as
   various aspects of its design and implementation. Frequent causes of
   frustration include extreme code bloat, heavy use of global
   variables,^[4] and an overcomplicated class hierarchy. From time to
   time these issues are discussed on the ROOT users mailing list.^[5]^[6]
   While scientists dissatisfied with ROOT have in the past managed to
   work around its flaws,^[7] some of the shortcomings are regularly
   addressed by the ROOT team. The CINT interpreter, for example, has been
   replaced by the Cling interpreter,^[8] and numerous bugs are fixed with
   every release.
