   Ancestry.com LLC is an American genealogy company based in Lehi, Utah.
   The largest for-profit genealogy company in the world, it operates a
   network of genealogical, historical records, and related genetic
   genealogy websites. It is owned by The Blackstone Group, which acquired
   the company on December 4, 2020, in a deal valued at $4.7
   billion.^[7]^[8]^[9]

   As of 2022, the company said it had provided access to 30 billion
   historical records, tripling its November 2018 figure of 10 billion
   records.^[10]^[11] In 2018 it also reported having 3 million paying
   subscribers, and to have sold 18 million DNA kits to customers.^[11] By
   2023, Ancestry was the largest provider of consumer DNA testing in the
   world with a network of over 25 million users,^[12] and Ancestry DNA
   testing is now available in 128 countries.

   As well as its main website, Ancestry operates country-specific
   versions for Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Sweden
   and the United Kingdom.^[13]

History

   [edit]

Ancestry

   [edit]

1983

   [edit]

   Ancestry Publishing was founded in 1983, producing genealogical data in
   print form, with more than 40 family history magazine titles and
   genealogy reference books published.^[14]^[15]

1990–1999

   [edit]

   In 1990, Paul Brent Allen and Dan Taggart, two Brigham Young University
   graduates, founded Infobases and began offering Latter-day Saints (LDS)
   publications on floppy disks. In 1988, Allen had worked at Folio
   Corporation, founded by his brother Curt and his brother-in-law Brad
   Pelo. The service was initially to help members of the church to
   research their ancestors.

   Infobases' first products were floppy disks and compact disks sold from
   the back seat of the founders' car. In 1994, Infobases was named among
   Inc. magazine's 500 fastest-growing companies.^[16] Their first
   offering on CD was the LDS Collectors Edition, released in April 1995,
   selling for $299.95,^[17] which was offered in an online version in
   August 1995.^[18] Ancestry officially went online with the launch of
   Ancestry.com in 1996.^[15]

   On January 1, 1997, Infobases' parent company, Western Standard
   Publishing, purchased Ancestry, Inc.,^[19] publisher of Ancestry
   magazine and genealogy books. Western Standard Publishing's CEO was
   Joseph A. Cannon, one of the principal owners of Geneva Steel.^[20]

   In July 1997, Allen and Taggart purchased Western Standard's interest
   in Ancestry, Inc. At the time, Brad Pelo was president and CEO of
   Infobases, and president of Western Standard. Less than six months
   earlier, he had been president of Folio Corporation, whose digital
   technology Infobases was using. In March 1997, Folio was sold to Open
   Market for $45 million.^[21] The first public evidence of the change in
   ownership of Ancestry magazine came with the July/August 1997 issue,
   which showed a newly reorganized Ancestry, Inc., as its publisher. That
   issue's masthead also included the first use of the Ancestry.com web
   address.

   More growth for Infobases occurred in July 1997, when Ancestry, Inc.
   purchased Bookcraft, Inc., a publisher of books written by leaders and
   officers of the LDS Church.^[22]^[23] Infobases had published many of
   Bookcraft's books as part of its LDS Collector's Library. Pelo also
   announced that Ancestry's product line would be greatly expanded in
   both CDs and online. Alan Ashton, a longtime investor in Infobases and
   founder of WordPerfect, was its chairman of the board.

   Allen and Taggart began running Ancestry, Inc. independently from
   Infobases in July 1997, and began creating one of the largest online
   subscription-based genealogy database services.^[24]

   In April 1999, to better focus on its Ancestry.com and MyFamily.com
   Internet businesses, Infobases sold the Bookcraft brand name and its
   catalog of print books to its major competitor in the LDS book market,
   Deseret Book. Included in the sale were the rights to Infobases' LDS
   Collectors Library on CD. A year earlier, Deseret Book had released a
   competing product called GospeLink, and the two products were combined
   as a single product by Deseret Book.^[25]^[26]

   The MyFamily.com website launched in December 1998, with additional
   free sites beginning in March 1999.^[27] The site generated one-million
   registered users within its first 140 days.^[24] The company raised
   more than US$90 million in venture capital from investors^[24] and
   changed its name on November 17, 1999, from Ancestry.com, Inc. to
   MyFamily.com, Inc. Its three Internet genealogy sites were then called
   Ancestry.com, FamilyHistory.com, and MyFamily.com.^[28] Sales were
   about US$62 million for 2002 and US$99 million for 2003.^[29]
   [220px-Ancestry_dot_com_headquarters.jpg] Former Ancestry.com
   headquarters in Provo, Utah

2000–2009

   [edit]

   In March 2004, the company, which had outgrown its call center in Orem,
   Utah, opened a new call center, which accommodated about 700 agents at
   a time, in Provo.^[30] Heritage Makers was acquired by MyFamily.com in
   September 2005.^[31]

   On November 5, 2009, Ancestry.com became a publicly traded company on
   NASDAQ (symbol: ACOM), with an initial public offering of 7.4 million
   shares priced at $13.50 per share, underwritten by Morgan Stanley, Bank
   of America, Merrill Lynch, Jefferies & Company, Piper Jaffray, and BMO
   Capital Markets.^[32]

2010–2019

   [edit]

   In 2010, Ancestry sold its book publishing assets to Turner Publishing
   Company.^[33]

   In 2010, Ancestry.com expanded its domestic operations with the opening
   of an office in San Francisco, California, staffed with brand new
   engineering, product, and marketing teams geared toward developing some
   of Ancestry's cutting-edge technology and services. In 2011, Ancestry
   launched an Android and iOS app.^[34]^[35]

   In December 2011, Ancestry.com moved the Social Security Death Index
   search behind a paywall and stopped displaying the Social Security
   information of people who had died within the past 10 years, because of
   identity theft concerns.^[36]

   In March 2012, Ancestry.com acquired the collection of DNA assets from
   GeneTree.^[37]

   In September 2012, Ancestry.com expanded its international operations
   with the opening of its European headquarters in Dublin, Ireland. The
   Dublin office includes a new call center for international customers,
   as well as product, marketing, and engineering teams.^[38]^[39]

   In October 2012, Ancestry.com agreed to be acquired by a private equity
   group consisting of Permira Advisers LLP, members of Ancestry.com's
   management team, including CEO Tim Sullivan and CFO Howard Hochhauser,
   and Spectrum Equity, for $32 per share or around $1.6 billion.^[40] At
   the same time, Ancestry.com purchased a photo digitization and sharing
   service called 1000Memories.^[41]

   In 2013, Ancestry acquired Find a Grave from Jim Tipton, who had
   created the original site in 1995. Ancestry subsequently launched a
   redesigned version of Find a Grave in 2017.

   On July 16, 2015, Ancestry launched AncestryHealth, and announced the
   appointment of Cathy A. Petti as its Chief Health Officer.^[42] That
   year, Ancestry partnered with the Google subsidiary, Calico, to focus
   on longevity research and therapeutics, in an effort to investigate
   human heredity of lifespan.^[43]^[44]

   In April 2016, GIC Private Limited (a sovereign wealth fund owned by
   the Government of Singapore) and Silver Lake (a private equity fund
   manager) bought equity stakes in Ancestry.com.^[45] The estimated
   market value of Ancestry.com in 2017 was more than $3 billion.^[46]

   In June 2017, Ancestry.com stated that it was migrating all of its
   applications and data to Amazon Web Services (AWS).^[47]^[48]

   Through vintage photographs, a woman was able to document eight
   generations of her family, dating back to 1805, including an
   interracial couple.^[49] A controversial Ancestry.com advertisement had
   run on television stations in Utah, showing a slavery-era interracial
   couple. The advertisement was criticized by a news correspondent for
   Boston radio station WBUR-FM and MSNBC, and law professor Melissa
   Murray, on the grounds that it romanticized slavery in the antebellum
   South. In April 2019, Ancestry withdrew the advertisement with an
   apology.^[50]

   In November 2018, Ancestry claimed to have over 10 billion digitized
   records and over three-million paying customers.^[51]

   In December 2018, after authorities arrested the Golden State Killer
   and used GEDmatch to solve the case, Ancestry.com and 23andMe announced
   a data policy that they would not allow their DNA profiles to be used
   for crime solving without a valid legal process such as a search
   warrant, as they believe it violates users' privacy.^[52]^[53] In the
   2021 case of the murder of George Seitz, Ancestry.com was used to help
   identify the remains of a crime victim.^[54]

2020–present

   [edit]

   In August 2020, The Blackstone Group announced plans to acquire
   Ancestry for $4.7 billion,^[7] and in December 2020 the acquisition
   occurred.

   In February 2021, Ancestry announced Deb Liu, a former Facebook
   executive, as their CEO effective March 1.^[1]

   In November 2021, Ancestry announced the acquisition of French
   Genealogy Company Geneanet.^[55]

   In March 2023, Ancestry announced that it had won a contract to
   digitize over 3 million British Army service records, which it would
   release from 2024 through 2029. In February 2021 the Ministry Of
   Defence commenced transferring 9.7 million military records for
   individuals with a discharge date before 31 December 1963 to The
   National Archives UK, its largest record transfer in the history of the
   organization.^[56]

AncestryDNA

   [edit]

   AncestryDNA is a subsidiary of Ancestry LLC. AncestryDNA offers a
   direct-to-consumer genealogical DNA test.^[57] Consumers provide a
   sample of their DNA to the company for analysis. AncestryDNA then uses
   DNA sequences to infer family relationships with other Ancestry DNA
   users, and to infer "ancestral regions"^[58] (previously "ethnicity
   estimates").^[59] Previously, Ancestry.com also offered paternal
   Y-chromosome DNA and maternal mitochondrial DNA tests, but those were
   discontinued in June 2014.^[60] The company describes the technical
   process of testing in a series of scientific white papers.^[61] In July
   2020, the company claimed that their database contained 18 million
   completed DNA kits bought by customers.^[62]^[51]^[63]

   Ancestry DNA is commonly used for donor conceived persons to find their
   biological siblings and in some cases their sperm or egg donor.^[64]

   The testing itself is performed by Quest Diagnostics.^[65]

   AncestryDNA offers the option to participate in their Human Diversity
   Project, a "scientific research project aimed at helping scientists
   better understand population history, population movements, and human
   health".^[66]^[67]

   Members can also pay an additional fee to access DNA traits, which
   range from predicted physical traits to limited health data.

Know Your Pet DNA

   [edit]

   Since 2023, Ancestry has also offered genetic testing for pets, which
   at the moment is limited to dogs.^[3] The test compares the DNA to over
   400 breeds.

Find a Grave

   [edit]

   Main article: Find a Grave

   On September 30, 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Find a
   Grave. Site editor Jim Tipton said of the purchase that Ancestry.com
   had "been linking and driving traffic to the site for several years.
   Burial information is a wonderful source for people researching their
   family history". Ancestry.com launched a mobile app in March 2014.^[68]

Fold3

   [edit]

   Fold3 is a premium portal that specializes in military genealogy.
   Subscribers access an online database with military records, including
   stories, photos, and personal documents. It was rebranded as Forces War
   Records in the British & Commonwealth nations in April 2023.^[69]

   The website also features the Guion Miller Roll, an Eastern Cherokee
   tribal roll.^[70]

Footnote

   [edit]

   Ancestry.com acquired iArchives, Inc., and its service footnote.com, in
   2010. The purchase brought in assets including processes for digitizing
   microfilm.^[71]^[72] Footnote was rebranded Fold3 in 2011.^[73]

Geneanet

   [edit]

   Main article: Geneanet

   On August 31, 2021, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of Geneanet.
   Geneanet explains that the acquisition by Ancestry is the consequence
   of the failure of the Filae negotiations with the birth of a formidable
   competitor. The Geneanet.org site, which must remain autonomous,
   indicates that it will give access to many databases indexed by
   Ancestry within the framework of Premium subscriptions.^[74]

Archives.com

   [edit]

   Archives.com was bought by Ancestry for $100 million in 2012.^[75]
   Archives.com is a genealogy website specializing in census and vital
   records. As of November 29, 2023, Archives.com claimed 11.8 billion
   photos, newspapers, census, and vital records in its collections.^[76]

Newspapers.com

   [edit]

   In 2012, Ancestry spun off its digitized online newspaper components
   into a standalone service, Newspapers.com.^[77] By 2024, the site had
   over 25,000 newspapers able to be searched, including some from ten
   different countries.

   The Web site's principal competitor is NewspaperArchive, which claims
   it has online newspapers dating from 1607 worldwide, and its index in
   March 2024 included over 16,000 newspapers.^[78] Both websites have
   similar models for increasing their databases: striking deals with
   libraries, publishers and historical organizations to scan the
   publications for free to include in their database. Some participants
   see the process of free scanning as an easier, cheaper and quicker way
   to get their publications online than working through the U.S.
   government-operated National Digital Newspaper Program.^[79]^[80]

RootsWeb

   [edit]

   RootsWeb, acquired by Ancestry in June 2000, is a free genealogy
   community that uses online forums, mailing lists, and other resources
   to help people research their family history. Users can upload GEDCOM
   files of their information for others to search at the WorldConnect
   portion of the site. Trees uploaded to WorldConnect are searchable at
   both the RootsWeb and Ancestry Web sites.

   On December 20, 2017, a file containing 300,000 RootsWeb user names,
   passwords, and email addresses was exposed to the Internet. The 300,000
   records were from RootsWeb surname list service; 55,000 of those
   records were also Ancestry.com login credentials.^[81] By 2024, the
   hosted Web sites were all read-only, disabling all user logins.

We Remember

   [edit]

   We Remember is a free online memorial platform,^[82] which was launched
   by Ancestry in November 2017.^[83]^[84] It allows users to create a
   space to preserve and share photos and videos about the deceased.^[85]

Forces War Records

   [edit]

   Forces War Records was a low cost provider of transcribed genealogical
   data from British sources. The irony was that much of the content
   behind their paywall had simply been taken from public domain sources.
   As a consequence, there was a lack of transparency as to where they
   sourced their content from.^[86]^[87] (See Wikipedia:Reliable
   sources/Noticeboard/Archive 315#RfC: forces-war-records.co.uk) They
   came under criticism for difficulties in canceling subscriptions, with
   a complaint about their misleading marketing being upheld by the
   Advertising Standards Authority.^[88]

   Acquired by Ancestry on May 24, 2021, the press release announced that
   'Forces War Records is a British military genealogy-specialist website
   with a unique product that helps people both discover and contextualize
   their family's military history.'^[89] Given that Fold3 had a negative
   perception as "US-centric",^[90] the same dataset offerings and web
   architecture were used in the UK, albeit branded as Forces War Records,
   from April 2023 onwards.^[69] The provision of service records for the
   first time ever, via this brand, as a consequence of the linkage with
   fold3, has reinvigorated the brand. Not only transcriptions, but also
   images of source documents are now available to the subscriber.^[91] In
   support of the brand being relaunched as a premium portal that
   specializes in military genealogy, half a million records were added to
   the (FWR/Fold3) portal in July 2023.^[92]

Past products

   [edit]

     * Family Origins^[93]^[94]^[95]
     * Family Tree Maker was purchased by Software MacKiev in
       2016.^[96]^[97]
     * Genealogy.com, which maintains a genealogy research website, was
       acquired by MyFamily.com in 2003.^[98]
     * Generations Family Tree (originally called "Reunion for
       Windows")^[99]
     * MyFamily.com allowed members to create private family, or group,
       websites. In May 2010, MyFamily closed its Bellevue, Washington,
       development office, effectively letting its entire staff go since
       none of the staff accepted an offer to move to Provo. Ancestry shut
       down MyFamily.com on September 5, 2014.^[100] At the time of the
       shutdown, MyFamily had not resolved discontent with the downloading
       process, which consisted of capturing miscellaneous uncatalogued
       photos, with alphanumeric names and no data attached, and various
       calendar documents, thus leaving behind the associated data, File
       Cabinet documents, family recipes, and all other information.^[100]
     * ROOTS software series by CommSoft^[101]^[102] was one of the first
       publishers of series of genealogy software programs, created in the
       1980s, and available until 1997. Commsoft released the following:
       ROOTS89 for the Heath H-8 series of personal computers; ROOTS/M for
       the CP/M operating system; and ROOTS II for MS-DOS, followed by
       ROOTS III and ROOTS IV; and ROOTS V for Windows along with Visual
       ROOTS for Microsoft Windows.

       records), turned out to be transcriptions, not the original
       documents themselves (which Ancestry have). When I cancelled my
