   First or top-most directory in a hierarchy
   For other uses, see Root (disambiguation).
   [220px-OpenIndiana_2015_Console_LS.png] View of the root directory in
   the OpenIndiana operating system

   In a computer file system, and primarily used in the Unix and Unix-like
   operating systems, the root directory is the first or top-most
   directory in a hierarchy.^[1] It can be likened to the trunk of a tree,
   as the starting point where all branches originate from. The root file
   system is the file system contained on the same disk partition on which
   the root directory is located; it is the filesystem on top of which all
   other file systems are mounted as the system boots up.^[2]

Unix-like systems

   [edit]

   Unix abstracts the nature of this tree hierarchy entirely and in Unix
   and Unix-like systems the root directory is denoted by the / (slash)
   sign. Though the root directory is conventionally referred to as /, the
   directory entry itself has no name – its path is the "empty" part
   before the initial directory separator character (/). All file system
   entries, including mounted file systems are "branches" of this
   root.^[1]

chroot

   [edit]

   In UNIX-like operating systems, each process has its own idea of what
   the root directory is. For most processes this is the same as the
   system's actual root directory, but it can be changed by calling the
   chroot system call. This is typically done to create a secluded
   environment to run software that requires legacy libraries and
   sometimes to simplify software installation and debugging. Chroot is
   not meant to be used for enhanced security as the processes inside can
   break out.^[3]

Super-root

   [edit]
   See also: Newcastle Connection

   Some Unix systems support a directory below the root directory.
   Normally, "/.." points back to the same inode as "/", however, under
   MUNIX [de], this can be changed to point to a super-root directory,
   where remote trees can be mounted.^[4]^[5] If, for example, two
   workstations "pcs2a" and "pcs2b" were connected via "connectnodes" and
   "uunite" startup script, "/../pcs2b" could be used to access the root
   directory of "pcs2b" from "pcs2a".

DOS/Windows systems

   [edit]

   Under DOS, OS/2, and Microsoft Windows, each partition has a drive
   letter assignment (e.g. the C partition is labeled C:\) and there is no
   public root directory on it.

Related uses

   [edit]

   On many Unixes, there is also a directory named
   /root (pronounced "slash root").^[6] This is the home directory of the
   'root' superuser. On many Mac and iOS systems this superuser home
   directory is /var/root.^[6]

   A home page's URL usually points to the root of the respective
   website's domain name.
