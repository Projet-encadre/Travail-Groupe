   Root is a Czech black metal band.

Biography

   [edit]

   Root were formed by vocalist Big Boss and guitarist Blackie in late
   1987.^[1] According to Big Boss, in the beginning, they knew no foreign
   bands and could do no tape trading.^[2] Although the first demo
   recording mentioned on their homepage's discography section is Deep in
   Hell,^[3] according to their biography, they recorded their first
   official demo tape Reap of Hell after a few rehearsals.^[1] Root played
   their first concert in September 1988. The next demo cassette, War of
   Rats, was released in 1988, followed by Messengers from Darkness in
   1989. Vocalist Big Boss played drums on these recordings.^[1] Whereas
   Messengers from Darkness is mentioned as "the third and last" demo
   cassette in their biography,^[1] the discography section lists The
   Trial as the last one.^[3]

   In 1990, the band released the single 7 černých jezdců / 666, with
   artwork done by Master's Hammer vocalist František Štorm. To promote
   their first album, Zjevení (again with artwork by Štorm), they recorded
   a video for their song "Hřbitov", released on the Czech Death Metal
   Session compilation,^[1] with photographs by Štorm. Zjevení was also
   released as The Revelation.

   The second album, Hell Symphony, followed in 1992. In 1993, Root
   released their third album, The Temple in the Underworld, and recorded
   a video for the song "Aposiopesis". The following years "were in the
   sign of personal problems between two main personalities of ROOT, Big
   Boss and Blackie".^[1] In 1996, Root released their first concept
   album, Kärgeräs.^[1] Their fifth album, The Book, followed in 1999.

   In 2004, Root played on the Open Hell festival with Watain, Törr and
   other bands.^[4] In 2011, they released the album Heritage of Satan,
   featuring Aura Noir and Ava Inferi guitarist Rune "Blasphemer" Eriksen,
   Behemoth vocalist Adam "Nergal" Darski and Watain vocalist Erik
   Danielsson, who also created the album cover, as guest musicians.
   Although Big Boss is the only remaining founding member, the band's
   core now consists of him, bass player Golem and guitarist Ashok.^[5]

   On 28 September 2016 the band announced that they began work on their
   tenth studio album, Kärgeräs – Return from Oblivion, the sequel to
   their 1996 concept album Kärgeräs. It was released on 25 November
   2016.^[6]

Musical style and ideology

   [edit]

   According to Legacy journalist Christian Wachter, Root have, since
   their beginning, a very own style (although ostensibly Venom- and
   Bathory-oriented) with an occult aura and are one of the few bands
   deserving the term "cult".^[7] Portuguese band Moonspell mentioned Root
   as one of their influences.^[8] Rock Hard journalist Björn Thorsten
   Jaschinski called them "occult metal pioneers".^[9] His colleague
   Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann located The Book "in the triangle of death metal,
   gothic metal and gloomy rock" with folklore melodies that could be
   interesting for fans of Katatonia, My Dying Bride, Primordial and
   Thine.^[10] On Root's homepage, Black Seal is described as a mixture of
   "the heaviness of 'Hell Symphony', monumentality of 'The Temple In The
   Underworld', mystery of 'Kargeras' and the dark charm of 'The
   Book'";^[1] Mühlmann described it as a mix of Mercyful Fate, Moonspell,
   Anathema and old heavy metal.^[11] For Decibel journalist Chris D.,
   Heritage of Satan "feels less complete than, say, The Book, which is,
   for me at least, the best Root album to date".^[12] The album features
   "a few rocking songs", "Revenge of Hell" and "Legacy of Ancestors", as
   well as "more traditional black metal songs".^[12]

   Big Boss founded the Czech branch of the Church of Satan.^[7]^[12] He
   still lives his life according to Satanism,^[7]^[12] but "gave away all
   agenda […] to younger ones"^[12] and now believes that "everything that
   smells of organization is shit".^[12] Although Root are therefore close
   to LaVeyan Satanism, Watain (whose vocalist Erik Danielsson contributed
   to Heritage of Satan), who are Devil worshippers,^[13] called them and
   Törr "the legendary kings of Czech Black/Death Metal" and "defenders of
   the faith" when they announced they would play on the Open Hell
   festival in 2004.^[4] According to Big Boss, "the difference between us
   and Scandinavian groups is that I sing about Satanic magic and myths I
   create personally, whereas Swedes, Norwegians etc. sing about things
   that are already known. They therefore have another approach to these
   topics."^[7] On Heritage of Satan, the topic is the final, successful
   assault of the infernal hordes onto the earth, after which Satan gives
   His power to His son.^[7]
