   any root will take you to a special page containing all the root
   information.

Root Matrix

   Root matrix lists every word derived from a root, ordered according to
   part of speech (verbs, participles, nouns, adjectives and adverbs) and
   according to mode of the verb (causative, passive, intensive,
   denominative, etc.).

   root matrix

   The result is a comprehensive table of how the root appears within Pāḷi
   texts, useful for teachers and students alike.

Root Families

   Each root family contains every word with the same prefix and root.

   roots dict3

   These are very useful for seeing the range of nuanced meanings that a
   prefix and root combination produces.
