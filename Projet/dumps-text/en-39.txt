   Type of tissue at the tip of a plant root

   The root cap is a type of tissue at the tip of a plant root.^[1] It is
   also called calyptra. Root caps contain statocytes which are involved
   in gravity perception in plants.^[1] If the cap is carefully removed
   the root will grow randomly. The root cap protects the growing tip in
   plants.^[1] It secretes mucilage to ease the movement of the root
   through soil,^[1] and may also be involved in communication with the
   soil microbiota.^[1]

   The purpose of the root cap is to enable downward growth of the root,
   with the root cap covering the sensitive tissue in the root.^[2] Thanks
   to the presence of statocytes, the root cap enables geoperception or
   gravitropism. This allows the plant to grow downwards (with gravity) or
   upwards (against gravity).^[3]

   The root cap is absent in some parasitic plants^[4]^: 138  and some
   aquatic plants, in which a sac-like structure called the root pocket
   may form instead.^[5]^: 2–76
