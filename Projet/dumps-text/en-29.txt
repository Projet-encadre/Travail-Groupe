   root (n.)

   "underground, downward-growing part of a plant," late Old English rōt
   and in part from a Scandinavian cognate akin to Old Norse rot "root,"
   figuratively "cause, origin," from Proto-Germanic *wrot (source also of
   Old English wyrt "root, herb, plant," Old High German wurz, German Wurz
   "a plant," Gothic waurts "a root," with characteristic Scandinavian
   loss of -w- before -r-), from PIE root *wrād- "branch, root" (source of
   wort and radical). The usual Old English words for "root" were
   wyrttruma and wyrtwala.

   Figurative use, "source of a quality or condition," is from late 12c.

   sense is from 1550s. Philological sense from 1520s. Slang meaning
   "penis" is recorded from 1846. In African-American vernacular use, "a

     sorowes. [I Timothy vi in Tyndale, 1526]

   To take root is from mid-15c. as "settle in the ground," hence
   figurative use (by 1530s). Root beer, made from the extracts of various
   roots (sarsaparilla, sassafras, etc.), is recorded by 1841, American
   English; root doctor is from 1821. Roots "established ties with a
