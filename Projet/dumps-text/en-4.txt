   The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) is a reference describing the
   conventions used for the layout of Unix-like systems. It has been made
   popular by its use in Linux distributions, but it is used by other
   Unix-like systems as well.^[1] It is maintained by the Linux
   Foundation. The latest version is 3.0, released on 3 June 2015.^[2]

Directory structure

   [edit]
   [300px-Ubuntu_Filesystem_Hierarchy.png] Typical Ubuntu filesystem
   hierarchy

   In the FHS, all files and directories appear under the root directory
   /, even if they are stored on different physical or virtual devices.
   Some of these directories only exist in a particular system if certain
   subsystems, such as the X Window System, are installed.

   Most of these directories exist in all Unix-like operating systems and
   are generally used in much the same way; however, the descriptions here
   are those used specifically for the FHS and are not considered
   authoritative for platforms other than Linux.
   Directory Description
   / Primary hierarchy root and root directory of the entire file system
   hierarchy.
   /bin Essential command binaries that need to be available in
   single-user mode, including to bring up the system or repair it,^[3]
   for all users (e.g., cat, ls, cp).
   /boot Boot loader files (e.g., kernels, initrd).
   /dev Device files (e.g., /dev/null, /dev/disk0, /dev/sda1, /dev/tty,
   /dev/random).
   /etc Host-specific system-wide configuration files.

   There has been controversy over the meaning of the name itself. In
   early versions of the UNIX Implementation Document from Bell Labs, /etc
   is referred to as the etcetera directory,^[4] as this directory
   historically held everything that did not belong elsewhere (however,
   the FHS restricts /etc to static configuration files and may not
   contain binaries).^[5] Since the publication of early documentation,
   the directory name has been re-explained in various ways. Recent
   interpretations include backronyms such as "Editable Text
   Configuration" or "Extended Tool Chest".^[6]
   /etc/opt Configuration files for add-on packages stored in /opt.
   /etc/sgml Configuration files, such as catalogs, for software that
   processes SGML.
   /etc/X11 Configuration files for the X Window System, version 11.
   /etc/xml Configuration files, such as catalogs, for software that
   processes XML.
   /home Users' home directories, containing saved files, personal
   settings, etc.
   /lib Libraries essential for the binaries in /bin and /sbin.
   /lib<qual> Alternate format essential libraries. These are typically
   used on systems that support more than one executable code format, such
   as systems supporting 32-bit and 64-bit versions of an instruction set.
   Such directories are optional, but if they exist, they have some
   requirements.
   /media Mount points for removable media such as CD-ROMs (appeared in
   FHS-2.3 in 2004).
   /mnt Temporarily mounted filesystems.
   /opt Add-on application software packages.^[7]
   /proc Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as
   files. In Linux, corresponds to a procfs mount. Generally,
   automatically generated and populated by the system, on the fly.
   /root Home directory for the root user.
   /run Run-time variable data: Information about the running system since
   last boot, e.g., currently logged-in users and running daemons. Files
   under this directory must be either removed or truncated at the
   beginning of the boot process, but this is not necessary on systems
   that provide this directory as a temporary filesystem (tmpfs) (appeared
   in FHS-3.0 in 2015).
   /sbin Essential system binaries (e.g., fsck, init, route).
   /srv Site-specific data served by this system, such as data and scripts
   for web servers, data offered by FTP servers, and repositories for
   version control systems (appeared in FHS-2.3 in 2004).
   /sys Contains information about devices, drivers, and some kernel
   features.^[8]
   /tmp Directory for temporary files (see also /var/tmp). Often not
   preserved between system reboots and may be severely size-restricted.
   /usr Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority
   of (multi-)user utilities and applications. Should be shareable and
   read-only.^[9]^[10]
   /usr/bin Non-essential command binaries (not needed in single-user
   mode); for all users.
   /usr/include Standard include files.
   /usr/lib Libraries for the binaries in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.
   /usr/libexec Binaries run by other programs that are not intended to be
   executed directly by users or shell scripts (optional).
   /usr/lib<qual> Alternative-format libraries (e.g., /usr/lib32 for
   32-bit libraries on a 64-bit machine (optional)).
   /usr/local Tertiary hierarchy for local data, specific to this host.
   Typically has further subdirectories (e.g., bin, lib, share).^[NB 1]
   /usr/sbin Non-essential system binaries (e.g., daemons for various
   network services).
   /usr/share Architecture-independent (shared) data.
   /usr/src Source code (e.g., the kernel source code with its header
   files).
   /usr/X11R6 X Window System, Version 11, Release 6 (up to FHS-2.3,
   optional).
   /var Variable files: files whose content is expected to continually
   change during normal operation of the system, such as logs, spool
   files, and temporary e-mail files.
   /var/cache Application cache data. Such data are locally generated as a
   result of time-consuming I/O or calculation. The application must be
   able to regenerate or restore the data. The cached files can be deleted
   without loss of data.
   /var/lib State information. Persistent data modified by programs as
   they run (e.g., databases, packaging system metadata, etc.).
   /var/lock Lock files. Files keeping track of resources currently in
   use.
   /var/log Log files. Various logs.
   /var/mail Mailbox files. In some distributions, these files may be
   located in the deprecated /var/spool/mail.
   /var/opt Variable data from add-on packages that are stored in /opt.
   /var/run Run-time variable data. This directory contains system
   information data describing the system since it was booted.^[11]

   In FHS 3.0, /var/run is replaced by /run; a system should either
   continue to provide a /var/run directory or provide a symbolic link
   from /var/run to /run for backwards compatibility.^[12]
   /var/spool Spool for tasks waiting to be processed (e.g., print queues
   and outgoing mail queue).
   /var/spool/mail Deprecated location for users' mailboxes.^[13]
   /var/tmp Temporary files to be preserved between reboots.

FHS compliance

   [edit]

   Most Linux distributions follow the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard and
   declare it their own policy to maintain FHS
   compliance.^[14]^[15]^[16]^[17] GoboLinux^[18] and NixOS^[19] provide
   examples of intentionally non-compliant filesystem implementations.

   Some distributions generally follow the standard but deviate from it in
   some areas. The FHS is a "trailing standard", and so documents common
   practices at a point in time. Of course, times change, and distribution
   goals and needs call for experimentation. Some common deviations
   include:
     * Modern Linux distributions include a /sys directory as a virtual
       filesystem (sysfs, comparable to /proc, which is a procfs), which
       stores and allows modification of the devices connected to the
       system,^[20] whereas many traditional Unix-like operating systems
       use /sys as a symbolic link to the kernel source tree.^[21]
     * Many modern Unix-like systems (such as FreeBSD and OpenBSD) via
       their ports systems install third-party packages into /usr/local,
       while keeping code considered part of the operating system in /usr.
     * Some Linux distributions no longer differentiate between /lib and
       /usr/lib and have /lib symlinked to /usr/lib.^[22]
     * Some Linux distributions no longer differentiate between /bin and
       /usr/bin and between /sbin and /usr/sbin. They may symlink /bin to
       /usr/bin and /sbin to /usr/sbin. Other distributions choose to
       consolidate all four, symlinking them to /usr/bin.^[23]

   Modern Linux distributions include a /run directory as a temporary
   filesystem (tmpfs), which stores volatile runtime data, following the
   FHS version 3.0. According to the FHS version 2.3, such data were
   stored in /var/run, but this was a problem in some cases because this
   directory is not always available at early boot. As a result, these
   programs have had to resort to trickery, such as using /dev/.udev,
   /dev/.mdadm, /dev/.systemd or /dev/.mount directories, even though the
   device directory is not intended for such data.^[24] Among other
   advantages, this makes the system easier to use normally with the root
   filesystem mounted read-only. For example, below are the changes Debian
   made in its 2013 Wheezy release:^[25]
     * /dev/.* → /run/*
     * /dev/shm → /run/shm
     * /dev/shm/* → /run/*
     * /etc/* (writeable files) → /run/*
     * /lib/init/rw → /run
     * /var/lock → /run/lock
     * /var/run → /run
     * /tmp → /run/tmp

History

   [edit]

The name of usr

   [edit]

   /usr originally stood for "user".^[26] This was an artifact of early
   Unix programming. Specifically, when Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie
   were migrating Unix to a PDP-11, the contents of the /bin and /lib
   directories, which were to be the first directories mounted on startup
   and to contain all essentials for the OS to function, became too large
   to fit on an RK05 disk drive. So they put some of those files on a
   second RK05, making sure that the first drive contained everything
   required for loading the second one. The rest of the files were put
   into the /usr directory.^[27] When they got a third drive, users' files
   were moved to a new directory named /home.^[28]

   FHS was created as the FSSTND (short for "Filesystem Standard"^[29]),
   largely based on similar standards for other Unix-like operating
   systems. Notable examples are these: the
   hier(7) description of file system layout,^[30] which has existed since
   the release of Version 7 Unix (in 1979);^[31] the SunOS
   filesystem(7)^[32] and its successor, the Solaris
   filesystem(7).^[33]^[34]

Notes

   [edit]
    1. ^ Historically and strictly according to the standard, /usr/local
       is for data that must be stored on the local host (as opposed to
       /usr, which may be mounted across a network). Most of the time
       /usr/local is used for installing software/data that are not part
       of the standard operating system distribution (in such case, /usr
       would only contain software/data that are part of the standard
       operating system distribution). It is possible that the FHS
       standard may in the future be changed to reflect this de facto
       convention.
