   Ancestry.com LLC is an American [114]genealogy company based in
   [115]Lehi, Utah. The largest [116]for-profit genealogy company in the
   world, it operates a network of genealogical, historical records, and
   related [117]genetic genealogy websites. It is owned by [118]The
   Blackstone Group, which acquired the company on December 4, 2020, in a
   deal valued at $4.7 billion.^[119][7]^[120][8]^[121][9]

   As of 2022, the company said it had provided access to 30 billion
   historical records, tripling its November 2018 figure of 10 billion
   records.^[122][10]^[123][11] In 2018 it also reported having 3 million
   paying subscribers, and to have sold 18 million [124]DNA kits to
   customers.^[125][11] By 2023, Ancestry was the largest provider of
   consumer DNA testing in the world with a network of over 25 million
   users,^[126][12] and Ancestry DNA testing is now available in 128
   countries.

   As well as its main website, Ancestry operates country-specific
   versions for Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Mexico, Sweden
   and the United Kingdom.^[127][13]

History

   [[128]edit]

Ancestry

   [[129]edit]

1983

   [[130]edit]

   Ancestry Publishing was founded in 1983, producing genealogical data in
   print form, with more than 40 family history magazine titles and
   genealogy reference books published.^[131][14]^[132][15]

1990-1999

   [[133]edit]

   In 1990, Paul Brent Allen and Dan Taggart, two [134]Brigham Young
   University graduates, founded Infobases and began offering
   [135]Latter-day Saints (LDS) publications on [136]floppy disks. In
   1988, Allen had worked at [137]Folio Corporation, founded by his
   brother Curt and his brother-in-law [138]Brad Pelo. The service was
   initially to help members of the church to research their ancestors.

   Infobases' first products were [139]floppy disks and [140]compact disks
   sold from the back seat of the founders' car. In 1994, Infobases was
   named among [141]Inc. magazine's 500 fastest-growing
   companies.^[142][16] Their first offering on [143]CD was the LDS
   Collectors Edition, released in April 1995, selling for
   $299.95,^[144][17] which was offered in an online version in August
   1995.^[145][18] Ancestry officially went online with the launch of
   Ancestry.com in 1996.^[146][15]

   On January 1, 1997, Infobases' parent company, Western Standard
   Publishing, purchased Ancestry, Inc.,^[147][19] publisher of
   [148]Ancestry magazine and genealogy books. Western Standard
   Publishing's CEO was [149]Joseph A. Cannon, one of the principal owners
   of [150]Geneva Steel.^[151][20]

   In July 1997, Allen and Taggart purchased Western Standard's interest
   in Ancestry, Inc. At the time, [152]Brad Pelo was [153]president and
   CEO of Infobases, and president of Western Standard. Less than six
   months earlier, he had been president of Folio Corporation, whose
   digital technology Infobases was using. In March 1997, Folio was sold
   to [154]Open Market for $45 million.^[155][21] The first public
   evidence of the change in ownership of Ancestry magazine came with the
   July/August 1997 issue, which showed a newly reorganized Ancestry,
   Inc., as its publisher. That issue's masthead also included the first
   use of the Ancestry.com web address.

   More growth for Infobases occurred in July 1997, when Ancestry, Inc.
   purchased [156]Bookcraft, Inc., a publisher of books written by leaders
   and officers of the LDS Church.^[157][22]^[158][23] Infobases had
   published many of Bookcraft's books as part of its LDS Collector's
   Library. Pelo also announced that Ancestry's product line would be
   greatly expanded in both CDs and online. [159]Alan Ashton, a longtime
   investor in Infobases and founder of [160]WordPerfect, was its chairman
   of the board.

   Allen and Taggart began running Ancestry, Inc. independently from
   Infobases in July 1997, and began creating one of the largest online
   subscription-based genealogy database services.^[161][24]

   In April 1999, to better focus on its Ancestry.com and MyFamily.com
   Internet businesses, Infobases sold the Bookcraft brand name and its
   catalog of print books to its major competitor in the LDS book market,
   [162]Deseret Book. Included in the sale were the rights to Infobases'
   LDS Collectors Library on CD. A year earlier, Deseret Book had released
   a competing product called GospeLink, and the two products were
   combined as a single product by Deseret Book.^[163][25]^[164][26]

   The MyFamily.com website launched in December 1998, with additional
   free sites beginning in March 1999.^[165][27] The site generated
   one-million registered users within its first 140 days.^[166][24] The
   company raised more than US$90 million in venture capital from
   investors^[167][24] and changed its name on November 17, 1999, from
   Ancestry.com, Inc. to MyFamily.com, Inc. Its three Internet genealogy
   sites were then called Ancestry.com, FamilyHistory.com, and
   MyFamily.com.^[168][28] Sales were about US$62 million for 2002 and
   US$99 million for 2003.^[169][29]

   headquarters in [171]Provo, Utah

2000-2009

   [[172]edit]

   In March 2004, the company, which had outgrown its call center in
   [173]Orem, Utah, opened a new [174]call center, which accommodated
   about 700 agents at a time, in [175]Provo.^[176][30] [177]Heritage
   Makers was acquired by MyFamily.com in September 2005.^[178][31]

   On November 5, 2009, Ancestry.com became a publicly traded company on
   [179]NASDAQ (symbol: ACOM), with an initial public offering of 7.4
   million shares priced at $13.50 per share, underwritten by [180]Morgan
   Stanley, [181]Bank of America, [182]Merrill Lynch, [183]Jefferies &
   Company, [184]Piper Jaffray, and [185]BMO Capital Markets.^[186][32]

2010-2019

   [[187]edit]

   In 2010, Ancestry sold its book publishing assets to [188]Turner
   Publishing Company.^[189][33]

   In 2010, Ancestry.com expanded its domestic operations with the opening
   of an office in [190]San Francisco, California, staffed with brand new
   engineering, product, and marketing teams geared toward developing some
   of Ancestry's cutting-edge technology and services. In 2011, Ancestry
   launched an [191]Android and [192]iOS app.^[193][34]^[194][35]

   In December 2011, Ancestry.com moved the [195]Social Security Death
   Index search behind a [196]paywall and stopped displaying the Social
   Security information of people who had died within the past 10 years,
   because of [197]identity theft concerns.^[198][36]

   In March 2012, Ancestry.com acquired the collection of DNA assets from
   [199]GeneTree.^[200][37]

   In September 2012, Ancestry.com expanded its international operations
   with the opening of its European headquarters in [201]Dublin, Ireland.
   The Dublin office includes a new call center for international
   customers, as well as product, marketing, and engineering
   teams.^[202][38]^[203][39]

   In October 2012, Ancestry.com agreed to be acquired by a private equity
   group consisting of [204]Permira Advisers LLP, members of
   Ancestry.com's management team, including CEO Tim Sullivan and CFO
   Howard Hochhauser, and Spectrum Equity, for $32 per share or around
   $1.6 billion.^[205][40] At the same time, Ancestry.com purchased a
   photo digitization and sharing service called
   [206]1000Memories.^[207][41]

   In 2013, Ancestry acquired [208]Find a Grave from Jim Tipton, who had
   created the original site in 1995. Ancestry subsequently launched a
   redesigned version of Find a Grave in 2017.

   On July 16, 2015, Ancestry launched AncestryHealth, and announced the
   appointment of Cathy A. Petti as its Chief Health Officer.^[209][42]
   That year, Ancestry partnered with the [210]Google subsidiary,
   [211]Calico, to focus on longevity research and therapeutics, in an
   effort to investigate human heredity of lifespan.^[212][43]^[213][44]

   In April 2016, [214]GIC Private Limited (a sovereign wealth fund owned
   by the Government of Singapore) and [215]Silver Lake (a private equity
   fund manager) bought equity stakes in Ancestry.com.^[216][45] The
   estimated market value of Ancestry.com in 2017 was more than $3
   billion.^[217][46]

   In June 2017, Ancestry.com stated that it was migrating all of its
   applications and data to [218]Amazon Web Services
   (AWS).^[219][47]^[220][48]

   Through vintage photographs, a woman was able to document eight
   generations of her family, dating back to 1805, including an
   interracial couple.^[221][49] A controversial Ancestry.com
   advertisement had run on television stations in [222]Utah, showing a
   slavery-era interracial couple. The advertisement was criticized by a
   news correspondent for Boston radio station [223]WBUR-FM and
   [224]MSNBC, and law professor [225]Melissa Murray, on the grounds that
   it romanticized slavery in the [226]antebellum South. In April 2019,
   Ancestry withdrew the advertisement with an apology.^[227][50]

   In November 2018, Ancestry claimed to have over 10 billion digitized
   records and over three-million paying customers.^[228][51]

   In December 2018, after authorities arrested the [229]Golden State
   Killer and used [230]GEDmatch to solve the case, Ancestry.com and
   [231]23andMe announced a data policy that they would not allow their
   DNA profiles to be used for crime solving without a valid legal process
   such as a [232]search warrant, as they believe it violates users'
   privacy.^[233][52]^[234][53] In the 2021 case of the [235]murder of
   George Seitz, Ancestry.com was used to help identify the remains of a
   crime victim.^[236][54]

2020-present

   [[237]edit]

   In August 2020, [238]The Blackstone Group announced plans to acquire
   Ancestry for $4.7 billion,^[239][7] and in December 2020 the
   acquisition occurred.

   In February 2021, Ancestry announced [240]Deb Liu, a former Facebook
   executive, as their CEO effective March 1.^[241][1]

   In November 2021, Ancestry announced the acquisition of French
   Genealogy Company [242]Geneanet.^[243][55]

   In March 2023, Ancestry announced that it had won a contract to
   digitize over 3 million British Army service records, which it would
   release from 2024 through 2029. In February 2021 the Ministry Of
   Defence commenced transferring 9.7 million military records for
   individuals with a discharge date before 31 December 1963 to The
   National Archives UK, its largest record transfer in the history of the
   organization.^[244][56]

AncestryDNA

   [[245]edit]

   AncestryDNA is a subsidiary of Ancestry LLC. AncestryDNA offers a
   direct-to-consumer [246]genealogical DNA test.^[247][57] Consumers
   provide a sample of their DNA to the company for analysis. AncestryDNA
   then uses DNA sequences to infer family relationships with other
   Ancestry DNA users, and to infer "ancestral regions"^[248][58]
   (previously "[249]ethnicity estimates").^[250][59] Previously,
   Ancestry.com also offered paternal [251]Y-chromosome DNA and maternal
   [252]mitochondrial DNA tests, but those were discontinued in June
   2014.^[253][60] The company describes the technical process of testing
   in a series of scientific [254]white papers.^[255][61] In July 2020,
   the company claimed that their database contained 18 million completed
   DNA kits bought by customers.^[256][62]^[257][51]^[258][63]

   Ancestry DNA is commonly used for [259]donor conceived persons to find
   their biological siblings and in some cases their [260]sperm or
   [261]egg donor.^[262][64]

   The testing itself is performed by [263]Quest Diagnostics.^[264][65]

   AncestryDNA offers the option to participate in their Human Diversity
   Project, a "scientific research project aimed at helping scientists
   better understand population history, population movements, and human
   health".^[265][66]^[266][67]

   Members can also pay an additional fee to access DNA traits, which
   range from predicted physical traits to limited health data.

Know Your Pet DNA

   [[267]edit]

   Since 2023, Ancestry has also offered genetic testing for pets, which
   at the moment is limited to dogs.^[268][3] The test compares the DNA to
   over 400 breeds.

Find a Grave

   [[269]edit]

   Main article: [270]Find a Grave

   On September 30, 2013, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of
   [271]Find a Grave. Site editor Jim Tipton said of the purchase that
   Ancestry.com had "been linking and driving traffic to the site for
   several years. Burial information is a wonderful source for people
   researching their family history". Ancestry.com launched a mobile app
   in March 2014.^[272][68]

Fold3

   [[273]edit]

   Fold3 is a premium portal that specializes in military genealogy.
   Subscribers access an online database with military records, including
   stories, photos, and personal documents. It was rebranded as Forces War
   Records in the [274]British & Commonwealth nations in April
   2023.^[275][69]

   The website also features the [276]Guion Miller Roll, an [277]Eastern
   Cherokee tribal roll.^[278][70]

Footnote

   [[279]edit]

   Ancestry.com acquired [280]iArchives, Inc., and its service
   footnote.com, in 2010. The purchase brought in assets including
   processes for digitizing [281]microfilm.^[282][71]^[283][72] Footnote
   was rebranded Fold3 in 2011.^[284][73]

Geneanet

   [[285]edit]

   Main article: [286]Geneanet

   On August 31, 2021, Ancestry.com announced its acquisition of
   [287]Geneanet. Geneanet explains that the acquisition by Ancestry is
   the consequence of the failure of the Filae negotiations with the birth
   of a formidable competitor. The Geneanet.org site, which must remain
   autonomous, indicates that it will give access to many databases
   indexed by Ancestry within the framework of Premium
   subscriptions.^[288][74]

Archives.com

   [[289]edit]

   Archives.com was bought by Ancestry for $100 million in 2012.^[290][75]
   Archives.com is a genealogy website specializing in census and vital
   records. As of November 29, 2023, Archives.com claimed 11.8 billion
   photos, newspapers, census, and vital records in its
   collections.^[291][76]

Newspapers.com

   [[292]edit]

   In 2012, Ancestry spun off its digitized online newspaper components
   into a standalone service, Newspapers.com.^[293][77] By 2024, the site
   had over 25,000 newspapers able to be searched, including some from ten
   different countries.

   The Web site's principal competitor is [294]NewspaperArchive, which
   claims it has online newspapers dating from 1607 worldwide, and its
   index in March 2024 included over 16,000 newspapers.^[295][78] Both
   websites have similar models for increasing their databases: striking
   deals with libraries, publishers and historical organizations to scan
   the publications for free to include in their database. Some
   participants see the process of free scanning as an easier, cheaper and
   quicker way to get their publications online than working through the
   U.S. government-operated [296]National Digital Newspaper
   Program.^[297][79]^[298][80]

RootsWeb

   [[299]edit]

   RootsWeb, acquired by Ancestry in June 2000, is a free genealogy
   community that uses online forums, mailing lists, and other resources
   to help people research their family history. Users can upload
   [300]GEDCOM files of their information for others to search at the
   WorldConnect portion of the site. Trees uploaded to WorldConnect are
   searchable at both the RootsWeb and Ancestry Web sites.

   On December 20, 2017, a file containing 300,000 RootsWeb user names,
   passwords, and email addresses was exposed to the Internet. The 300,000
   records were from RootsWeb surname list service; 55,000 of those
   records were also Ancestry.com login credentials.^[301][81] By 2024,
   the hosted Web sites were all read-only, disabling all user logins.

We Remember

   [[302]edit]

   We Remember is a free online memorial platform,^[303][82] which was
   launched by Ancestry in November 2017.^[304][83]^[305][84] It allows
   users to create a space to preserve and share photos and videos about
   the deceased.^[306][85]

Forces War Records

   [[307]edit]

   Forces War Records was a low cost provider of transcribed genealogical
   data from British sources. The irony was that much of the content
   behind their paywall had simply been taken from public domain sources.
   As a consequence, there was a lack of transparency as to where they
   sourced their content from.^[308][86]^[309][87] (See
   [310]Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard/Archive 315#RfC:
   forces-war-records.co.uk) They came under criticism for difficulties in
   canceling subscriptions, with a complaint about their misleading
   marketing being upheld by the Advertising Standards
   Authority.^[311][88]

   Acquired by Ancestry on May 24, 2021, the press release announced that
   'Forces War Records is a British military genealogy-specialist website
   with a unique product that helps people both discover and contextualize
   their family's military history.'^[312][89] Given that Fold3 had a
   negative perception as "US-centric",^[313][90] the same dataset
   offerings and web architecture were used in the UK, albeit branded as
   Forces War Records, from April 2023 onwards.^[314][69] The provision of
   service records for the first time ever, via this brand, as a
   consequence of the linkage with fold3, has reinvigorated the brand. Not
   only transcriptions, but also images of source documents are now
   available to the subscriber.^[315][91] In support of the brand being
   relaunched as a premium portal that specializes in military genealogy,
   half a million records were added to the (FWR/Fold3) portal in July
   2023.^[316][92]

       Provo. Ancestry shut down MyFamily.com on September 5,

       resolved discontent with the downloading process, which consisted
       of capturing miscellaneous uncatalogued photos, with alphanumeric
       names and no data attached, and various calendar documents, thus
       leaving behind the associated data, File Cabinet documents, family

       newsletter (I hear a lot of you saying 'I thought you stopped
       writing it a long time ago.'). As many of you know, we (FormalSoft)
       have been working on a new genealogy program called RootsMagic
       which we released in February 2002. Many of you have been using
       Family Origins since we first licensed it to Parsons Technology
       over 12 years ago. You have gone through all the company changes
       with us (Parsons, Intuit, Broderbund, The Learning Co., Mattel,
