   [11]root (n.)

   "underground, downward-growing part of a plant," late Old English rot
   and in part from a Scandinavian cognate akin to Old Norse rot "root,"
   figuratively "cause, origin," from Proto-Germanic *wrot (source also of
   Old English wyrt "root, herb, plant," Old High German wurz, German Wurz
   "a plant," Gothic waurts "a root," with characteristic Scandinavian
   loss of -w- before -r-), from PIE root [12]*wrad- "branch, root"
   (source of [13]wort and [14]radical). The usual Old English words for
   "root" were wyrttruma and wyrtwala.

   Figurative use, "source of a quality or condition," is from late 12c.
   Of the base parts of teeth, hair, etc., from early 13c. Mathematical
   sense is from 1550s. Philological sense from 1520s. Slang meaning
   "penis" is recorded from 1846. In African-American vernacular use, "a
   spell effected by magical properties of roots," by 1935. The sense of
   "person considered as the source or offspring of a family or clan" is
   by early 14c., chiefly biblical.

     For coveteousnes is the rote of all evylle, which whill some lusted
     after, they erde from the feyth, and tanglyd themselves with many
     sorowes. [I Timothy vi in Tyndale, 1526]

   To take root is from mid-15c. as "settle in the ground," hence
   figurative use (by 1530s). Root beer, made from the extracts of various
   roots (sarsaparilla, sassafras, etc.), is recorded by 1841, American
   English; root doctor is from 1821. Roots "established ties with a
   locality or region; one's background or cultural origins" is by 1921.

   "dig with the snout," 1530s, wroot, of swine, from Middle English

   dig out, root," Middle Low German wroten, Middle Dutch wroeten, Old
   High German ruozian "to plow up"), from PIE root *wrod- "to root,
   gnaw."
