   "underground, downward-growing part of a plant," late Old English rot

   "a plant," Gothic waurts "a root," with characteristic Scandinavian
   loss of -w- before -r-), from PIE root [12]*wrad- "branch, root"
   (source of [13]wort and [14]radical). The usual Old English words for
   "root" were wyrttruma and wyrtwala.
