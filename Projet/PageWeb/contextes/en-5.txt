   a solution is a value or a collection of values (one for each unknown)
   such that, when [122]substituted for the unknowns, the equation becomes
   an [123]equality. A solution of an equation is often called a root of
   the equation, particularly but not only for [124]polynomial equations.
   The set of all solutions of an equation is its [125]solution set.

   mentioned above. In some other cases, in particular if the equation is
   in one unknown, it is possible to solve the equation for
   [202]rational-valued unknowns (see [203]Rational root theorem), and
   then find solutions to the Diophantine equation by restricting the
   solution set to integer-valued solutions. For example, the polynomial

   Examples of inverse functions include the [208]nth root (inverse of
   x^n); the [209]logarithm (inverse of a^x); the [210]inverse
   trigonometric functions; and [211]Lambert's W function (inverse of

   With more complicated equations in real or [215]complex numbers, simple
   methods to solve equations can fail. Often, [216]root-finding
   algorithms like the [217]Newton-Raphson method can be used to find a
   numerical solution to an equation, which, for some applications, can be
