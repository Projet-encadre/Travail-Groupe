   In the [85]music theory of [86]harmony, the root is a specific [87]note
   that names and typifies a given [88]chord. Chords are often spoken
   about in terms of their root, their [89]quality, and their
   [90]extensions. When a chord is named without reference to quality, it
   is assumed to be [91]major--for example, a "C chord" refers to a C
   major triad, containing the notes C, E, and G. In a given harmonic
   context, the root of a chord need not be in [92]the bass position, as
   chords may be [93]inverted while retaining the same name, and therefore
   the same root.

   In [94]tertian harmonic theory, wherein chords can be considered stacks
   of third intervals (e.g. in [95]common practice [96]tonality), the root
   of a chord is the [97]note on which the subsequent thirds are stacked.
   For instance, the root of a [98]triad such as E Minor is E,
   independently of the vertical order in which the three notes (E, G and
   B) are presented. A triad can be in three possible positions, a "root
   position" with the root in the bass (i.e., with the root as the lowest
   note, thus E, G, B or E, B, G from lowest to highest notes), a
   [99]first inversion, e.g. G, B, E or G, E, B (i.e., with the note which
   is a third interval above the root, G, as the lowest note) and a
   [100]second inversion, e.g. B, E, G or B, G, E, in which the note that
   is a fifth interval above the root (B) is the lowest note.

   Regardless of whether a chord is in root position or in an inversion,
   the root remains the same in all three cases. Four-note seventh chords
   have four possible positions. That is, the chord can be played with the
   root as the bass note, the note a third above the root as the bass note
   (first inversion), the note a fifth above the root as the bass note
   (second inversion), or the note a seventh above the root as the bass
   note (third inversion). Five-note ninth chords know five positions,
   six-note eleventh chords know six positions, etc., but the root
   position always is that of the stack of thirds, and the root is the
   lowest note of this stack (see also [101]Factor (chord)).

Identifying roots

   [[116]edit]
   [117][220px-Determining_chord_root_from_inversion.png] Determining
   chord root from inversion [118]Play^[119]i-o. "Revoicing inverted
   triads to root position".^[120][1]

   The idea of chord root links to that of a chord's [121]root position,
   as opposed to its [122]inversion. When speaking of a "C triad" (C E G),
   the name of the chord (C) also is its root. When the root is the lowest
   note in the chord, it is in root position. When the root is a higher
   note (E G C or G C E), the chord is inverted but retains the same root.
   Classified chords in tonal music usually can be described as stacks of
   thirds (even although some notes may be missing, particularly in chords
   containing more that three or four notes, i.e. 7ths, 9ths, and above).
   The safest way to recognize a chord's root, in these cases, is to
   rearrange the possibly inverted chord as a stack of thirds: the root
   then is the lowest note.

   There are shortcuts to this: in inverted triads, the root is directly
   above the interval of a fourth, in inverted sevenths, it is directly
   above the interval of a second.^[123][1] With chord types, such as
--
   possible chordal analysis may be possible. For example, in a tonal
   piece of music, the notes C, E, G, A, sounded as a chord, could be
   analyzed as a C major sixth chord in root position (a major triad - C,
   E, G - with an added sixth - A - above the root) or as a first
   inversion A minor seventh chord (the A minor seventh chord contains the
   notes A, C, E and G, but in this example, the C note, the third of the
   A minor chord, is in the bass). Deciding which note is the root of this
   chord could be determined by considering context. If the chord spelled
   C, E, G, A occurs immediately before a D^7 chord (spelled D, F#, A, C),
--

   Various devices have been imagined to notate inverted chords and their
   roots:
     * [124]Chord names and symbols (e.g., C major, A minor, G^7 etc.)
     * [125]Roman numeral analysis (e.g., I to indicate the [126]tonic
--
       voice/lowest note)

   The concept of root has been extended for the description of intervals
   of two notes: the interval can either be analyzed as formed from
   stacked thirds (with the inner notes missing): third, fifth, seventh,
   etc., (i.e., intervals corresponding to odd numerals), and its low note
   considered as the root; or as an inversion of the same: second
   (inversion of a seventh), fourth (inversion of a fifth), sixth
   (inversion of a third), etc., (intervals corresponding to even
   numerals) in which cases the upper note is the root. See [129]Interval.

   Some theories of common-practice tonal music admit the [130]sixth as a
   possible interval above the root and consider in some cases that ^6
   [5] chords nevertheless are in root position - this is the case
   particularly in [131]Riemannian theory. Chords that cannot be reduced
   to stacked thirds (e.g. chords of stacked fourths) may not be amenable
   to the concept of root, although in practice, in a [132]lead sheet, the
   composer may specify that a quartal chord has a certain root (e.g., a
   [133]fake book chart that indicates that a song uses an A^sus4(addb7)
   chord, which would use the notes A, D, G. Even though this is a quartal
   chord, the composer has indicated that it has a root of A.)

   A [134]major scale contains seven unique [135]pitch classes, each of
   which might serve as the root of a chord:

   position triads from C major scale^[137][2] [138]Play^[139]i-o.

   Chords in [140]atonal music are often of indeterminate root, as are
   equal-interval chords and [141]mixed-interval chords; such chords are
   often best characterized by their interval content.^[142][3]
--
   in Otto Sigfried Harnish's Artis musicae (1608), which describes
   perfect triads in which the lower note of the fifth is expressed in its
   own position, and imperfect ones, in which the base (i.e., root) of the
   chord appears only higher. [144]Johannes Lippius, in his Disputatio
   musica tertia (1610) and Synopsis musicae novae (1612), is the first to
   use the term "triad" (trias harmonica); he also uses the term "root"
   (radix), but in a slightly different meaning.^[145][4] [146]Thomas
   Campion, A New Way of Making Fowre Parts in Conterpoint, London, c.
   1618, notes that when chords are in first inversions (sixths), the bass
   is not "a true base", which is implicitly a third lower. Campion's
   "true base" is the root of the chord.^[147][5]

   Full recognition of the relationship between the triad and its
--
   Traité d'harmonie (1722). Rameau was not the first to discover triadic
   inversion,^[149][6] but his main achievement is to have recognized the
   importance of the succession of roots (or of chords identified by their
   roots) for the construction of tonality (see below, [150]Root
   progressions).

Root vs fundamental

   [[151]edit]

   The concept of chord root is not the same as that of the fundamental of
   a complex vibration. When a [152]harmonic [153]sound, i. e. a sound
   with harmonic partials, lacks a component at the fundamental frequency
--
   distant by the intervals of a 12th and a 17th. For instance, C3 E3 G3
   is a major triad, but the corresponding harmonic partials would be C3,
   G4 and E5. The root of the triad is an abstract C, while the (missing)
   fundamental of C3 E3 G3 is C1 - which would usually not be heard.

Assumed root

   [[156]edit]
   [157][220px-Assumed_root_A_minor_ninth_chord.png] Assumed root, Am^7/B:
   A minor ninth chord without root and with B in the bass.^[158][7]
   [159]Play^[160]i-o Am^9/B, Am^7, then full Am9.

   An assumed root (also absent, or omitted root) is "when a chord does
   not contain a root ([which is] not unusual)".^[161][8] In any context,
   it is the unperformed root of a performed chord. This 'assumption' may
   be established by the interaction of physics and perception, or by pure
   convention. "We only interpret a chord as having its root omitted when
   the habits of the ear make it absolutely necessary for us to think of
   the absent root in such a place."[emphasis original].^[162][9] "We do
   not acknowledge omitted Roots except in cases where the mind is
   necessarily conscious of them ... There are also cases in instrumental
   accompaniment in which the root having been struck at the commencement
   of a measure, the ear feels it through the rest of the measure"
   (emphasis in original).^[163][10]

   In [164]guitar tablature, this may be indicated, "to show you where the
   root would be", and to assist one with, "align[ing] the chord shape at
   the appropriate [165]fret", with an assumed root in grey, other notes
   in white, and a sounded root in black.^[166][7]
   [167][220px-Diminished7thandMinor9thComparison.png] A comparison of the
   diminished 7th [168]Play^[169]i-o and dominant 7th^[170][11] (b9)

   seventh chord's use in [174]modulation: each assumed root, in
   parentheses, may be used as a [175]dominant, [176]tonic, or
   [177]supertonic.^[178][12] [179]Play ninth chords^[180]i-o Thus C,
   taken as dominant, would modulate to F.

   An example of an assumed root is the [181]diminished seventh chord, of
   which a note a major third below the chord is often assumed to be the
   absent root, making it a [182]ninth chord.^[183][13] The diminished
   seventh chord affords, "singular facilities for modulation", as it may
   be notated four ways, to represent four different assumed
   roots.^[184][12]

In jazz
--
   [[185]edit]

   In [186]jazz and [187]jazz fusion, roots are often omitted from chords
   when chord-playing musicians (e.g., [188]electric guitar, [189]piano,
   [190]Hammond organ) are improvising chords in an ensemble that includes
   a bass player (either [191]double bass, [192]electric bass, or other
   bass instruments), because the bass player plays the root. For example,
   if a band is playing a tune in the key of C major, if there is a
   [193]dominant seventh chord played on the [194]dominant chord (i.e.,
   G^7), the chord-playing musicians typically do not play the G note in
   their voicing of the chord, as they expect the bass player to play the
   root. The chord playing musicians usually play a voicing that includes
   the third, seventh, and additional extensions (often the ninth and
   thirteenth, even if they are not specified in the chord chart). Thus a
--
   second interval, except that it is one octave higher.)

Root progressions in music

   [[195]edit]
--
   The fundamental bass (basse fondamentale) is a concept proposed by
   Jean-Philippe Rameau, derived from the thoroughbass, to notate what
   would today be called the progression of chord roots rather than the
   actual lowest note found in the music, the bassline. From this Rameau
   formed rules for the progression of chords based on the intervals
   between their roots. Subsequently, [196]music theory has typically
   treated chordal roots as the defining feature of harmony.^[197][14]

     Why is it so important to know the root of the chord? Because the
     roots of the chords will sound whether we want them to or not,
     whether or not the alphabetical symbol is correct. The root
     progression which emerges may not coincide with what we think we
     have written; it may be better or it may be worse; but art does not
     permit chance. The root progression supports the work. The total
     root progression is heard as a substantive element, almost like
     another melody, and it determines the tonal basis of the music. And
     the tonal basis of a piece is very important to the construction of
--
   Roman numeral analysis may be said to derive from the theory of the
   fundamental bass, although it does not particularly theorize the
   succession of roots. The theory of the fundamental bass properly
   speaking has been revived in the 20th century by Arnold
   Schoenberg,^[199][16] Yizhak Sadaï^[200][17] and Nicolas
