Root Directory

   The root directory, or root folder, is the top-level [10]directory of a
   [11]file system. The directory structure can be visually represented as
   an upside-down tree, so the term "[12]root" represents the top level.
   All other directories within a [13]volume are "branches" or
   [14]subdirectories of the root directory.

   While all file systems have a root directory, it may be labeled
   differently depending on the [15]operating system. For example, in
   [16]Windows, the [17]default root directory is C:\. On [18]Unix systems
   and in [19]OS X, the root directory is typically labeled simply / (a
   single forward slash). As you move up directories within a file system,
   you will eventually reach the root directory.

Website Root Directory

   The root directory of a [20]website is not the top-level directory of
   the volume, but rather the top-level directory of the website folder.
   On an [21]Apache server, for example, the name of the root directory is
   public_html and is located within primary user folder for the website.
   Therefore, the root folder of a website can be accessed using a single
   forward slash. For example, a [22]link to a file called home.html
   within the root directory of a website can be accessed using the
   reference "/home.html."
