   secondary roots in a [204]cotton plant

   In [205]vascular plants, the roots are the [206]organs of a plant that
   are modified to provide anchorage for the plant and take in water and
   nutrients into the plant body, which allows plants to grow taller and
   faster.^[207][1] They are most often below the surface of the
   [208]soil, but roots can also be [209]aerial or aerating, that is,
   growing up above the ground or especially above water.^[210][2]

--
   [[211]edit]

   The major functions of roots are [212]absorption of water, [213]plant
   nutrition and anchoring of the plant body to the ground.^[214][3]

   of a [217]barley root

   Root morphology is divided into four zones: the [218]root cap, the
   [219]apical meristem, the elongation zone, and the hair.^[220][4] The
   [221]root cap of new roots helps the root penetrate the soil. These
   root caps are sloughed off as the root goes deeper creating a slimy
   surface that provides lubrication. The apical meristem behind the root
   cap produces new root cells that elongate. Then, root hairs form that
   absorb water and mineral nutrients from the soil.^[222][5] The first
   root in seed producing plants is the [223]radicle, which expands from
   the plant embryo after seed germination.

   When dissected, the arrangement of the cells in a root is [224]root
   hair, [225]epidermis, [226]epiblem, [227]cortex, [228]endodermis,
   [229]pericycle and, lastly, the [230]vascular tissue in the centre of a
   root to transport the water absorbed by the root to other places of the
   plant.^[[231]clarification needed]
   [232][220px-Ranunculus_Root_Cross_Section.png] Ranunculus root cross
   section

   Perhaps the most striking characteristic of roots that distinguishes
   them from other plant organs such as stem-branches and leaves is that
   roots have an endogenous^[233][6] origin, i.e., they originate and
   develop from an inner layer of the mother axis, such as
   [234]pericycle.^[235][7] In contrast, stem-branches and leaves are
   exogenous, i.e., they start to develop from the cortex, an outer layer.

   In response to the concentration of nutrients, roots also synthesise
   [236]cytokinin, which acts as a signal as to how fast the shoots can
   grow. Roots often function in storage of food and nutrients. The roots
   of most vascular plant species enter into symbiosis with certain
   [237]fungi to form [238]mycorrhizae, and a large range of other
   organisms including [239]bacteria also closely associate with
   roots.^[240][8]

   In its simplest form, the term root system architecture (RSA) refers to
   the spatial configuration of a plant's root system. This system can be
   extremely complex and is dependent upon multiple factors such as the
   species of the plant itself, the composition of the soil and the
   availability of nutrients.^[246][9] Root architecture plays the
   important role of providing a secure supply of nutrients and water as
   well as anchorage and support.

   The configuration of root systems serves to structurally support the
   plant, compete with other plants and for uptake of nutrients from the
   soil.^[247][10] Roots grow to specific conditions, which, if changed,
   can impede a plant's growth. For example, a root system that has
   developed in dry soil may not be as efficient in flooded soil, yet
   plants are able to adapt to other changes in the environment, such as
--
   [[249]edit]

   The main terms used to classify the architecture of a root system
   are:^[250][11]
   Branch magnitude Number of links (exterior or interior)
--
   [253]Radial)
   Link length Distance between branches
   Root angle Radial angle of a lateral root's base around the parent
   root's circumference, the angle of a lateral root from its parent root,
   and the angle an entire system spreads.
   Link radius Diameter of root

   All components of the root architecture are regulated through a complex
   interaction between genetic responses and responses due to
   environmental stimuli. These developmental stimuli are categorised as
--
   transduction pathways.^[255][12]

   Extrinsic factors affecting root architecture include gravity, light
   exposure, water and oxygen, as well as the availability or lack of
   nitrogen, phosphorus, sulphur, aluminium and sodium chloride. The main
   hormones (intrinsic stimuli) and respective pathways responsible for
   root architecture development include:
   [256]Auxin Lateral root formation, maintenance of apical dominance and
   [257]adventitious root formation.
   [258]Cytokinins Cytokinins regulate root apical meristem size and
   promote lateral root elongation.
   [259]Ethylene Promotes crown root formation.
   [260]Gibberellins Together with ethylene, they promote crown primordia
   growth and elongation. Together with auxin, they promote root
   elongation. Gibberellins also inhibit lateral root primordia
   initiation.

   [262][220px-Root_of_a_Tree.JPG] Roots of trees

   Early root growth is one of the functions of the apical meristem
   located near the tip of the root. The meristem cells more or less
   continuously divide, producing more meristem, [263]root cap cells
   (these are sacrificed to protect the meristem), and undifferentiated
   root cells. The latter become the primary tissues of the root, first
   undergoing elongation, a process that pushes the root tip forward in
   the growing medium. Gradually these cells differentiate and mature into
   specialized cells of the root tissues.^[264][13]

   Growth from apical meristems is known as primary growth, which
   encompasses all elongation. Secondary growth encompasses all growth in
   diameter, a major component of [265]woody plant tissues and many
   nonwoody plants. For example, storage roots of [266]sweet potato have
   secondary growth but are not woody. Secondary growth occurs at the
   [267]lateral meristems, namely the [268]vascular cambium and [269]cork
--
   In plants with secondary growth, the vascular cambium, originating
   between the xylem and the phloem, forms a [273]cylinder of tissue along
   the [274]stem and root.^[[275]citation needed] The vascular cambium
   forms new cells on both the inside and outside of the cambium cylinder,
   with those on the inside forming secondary xylem cells, and those on
   the outside forming secondary phloem cells. As secondary xylem
   accumulates, the "girth" (lateral dimensions) of the stem and root
   increases. As a result, tissues beyond the secondary phloem including
   the epidermis and cortex, in many cases tend to be pushed outward and
--
   process of wound healing in plants.^[280][15] It is also postulated
   that suberin could be a component of the apoplastic barrier (present at
   the outer cell layers of roots) which prevents toxic compounds from
   entering the root and reduces radial oxygen loss (ROL) from the
   [281]aerenchyma during waterlogging.^[282][16] In roots, the cork
   cambium originates in the [283]pericycle, a component of the vascular
   cylinder.^[284][16]
--
   annually.^[[285]citation needed] The xylem vessels are dead at maturity
   (in some) but are responsible for most water transport through the
   vascular tissue in stems and roots.
   Tree roots at Port Jackson

   Tree roots usually grow to three times the diameter of the branch
   spread, only half of which lie underneath the trunk and canopy. The
   roots from one side of a tree usually supply nutrients to the foliage
   on the same side. Some families however, such as [286]Sapindaceae (the
   [287]maple family), show no correlation between root location and where
   the root supplies nutrients on the plant.^[288][17]

Regulation
--
   [[289]edit]

   There is a correlation of roots using the process of [290]plant
   perception to sense their physical environment to grow,^[291][18]
   including the sensing of light,^[292][19] and physical barriers. Plants
   also sense gravity and respond through auxin pathways,^[293][20]
   resulting in [294]gravitropism. Over time, roots can crack foundations,
   snap water lines, and lift sidewalks. Research has shown that roots
   have ability to recognize 'self' and 'non-self' roots in same soil
   environment.^[295][21]

   The correct environment of [296]air, mineral [297]nutrients and
   [298]water directs plant roots to grow in any direction to meet the
   plant's needs. Roots will shy or shrink away from dry^[299][22] or
   other poor soil conditions.

   [300]Gravitropism directs roots to grow downward at [301]germination,
   the growth mechanism of plants that also causes the shoot to grow
   upward.^[302][23] Different types of roots such as primary, seminal,
   lateral and crown are maintained at different gravitropic setpoint
   angles i.e. the direction in which they grow. Recent research show that
   root angle in cereal crops such as barley and wheat is regulated by a
   novel gene called Enhanced Gravitropism 1 (EGT1).^[303][24]

   Research indicates that plant roots growing in search of productive
   nutrition can sense and avoid soil compaction through diffusion of the
   gas [304]ethylene.^[305][25]
   [306][220px-ArabidopsisLatRoot.jpg] Fluorescent imaging of an emerging
   lateral root

Shade avoidance response
--
   When a plant is under dense vegetation, the presence of other
   vegetation nearby will cause the plant to avoid lateral growth and
   experience an increase in upward shoot, as well as downward root
   growth. In order to escape shade, plants adjust their root
   architecture, most notably by decreasing the length and amount of
   lateral roots emerging from the primary root. Experimentation of mutant
   variants of [308]Arabidopsis thaliana found that plants sense the Red
   to Far Red light ratio that enters the plant through photoreceptors
--
   red light and reflect far-red light, which will cause the ratio red to
   far red light to lower. The phytochrome PhyA that senses this Red to
   Far Red light ratio is localized in both the root system as well as the
   shoot system of plants, but through knockout mutant experimentation, it
   was found that root localized PhyA does not sense the light ratio,
   whether directly or axially, that leads to changes in the lateral root
   architecture.^[311][26] Research instead found that shoot localized
   PhyA is the phytochrome responsible for causing these architectural
   changes of the lateral root. Research has also found that phytochrome
   completes these architectural changes through the manipulation of auxin
   distribution in the root of the plant.^[312][26] When a low enough Red
   to Far Red ratio is sensed by PhyA, the phyA in the shoot will be
   mostly in its active form.^[313][27] In this form, PhyA stabilize the
   [314]transcription factor HY5 causing it to no longer be degraded as it
   is when phyA is in its inactive form. This stabilized transcription
   factor is then able to be transported to the roots of the plant through
   the [315]phloem, where it proceeds to induce its own transcription as a
   way to amplify its signal. In the roots of the plant HY5 functions to
   inhibit an auxin response factor known as ARF19, a response factor
   responsible for the translation of PIN3 and LAX3, two well known auxin
--
   ARF19, the level and activity of [318]auxin transporters PIN3 and LAX3
   is inhibited.^[319][27] Once inhibited, auxin levels will be low in
   areas where lateral root emergence normally occurs, resulting in a
   failure for the plant to have the emergence of the lateral root
   primordium through the root [320]pericycle. With this complex
   manipulation of Auxin transport in the roots, lateral root emergence
   will be inhibited in the roots and the root will instead elongate
   downwards, promoting vertical plant growth in an attempt to avoid
   shade.^[321][26]^[322][27]

   Research of Arabidopsis has led to the discovery of how this auxin
   mediated root response works. In an attempt to discover the role that
   [323]phytochrome plays in lateral root development, Salisbury et al.
   (2007) worked with Arabidopsis thaliana grown on agar plates. Salisbury
   et al. used wild type plants along with varying protein knockout and
   gene knockout Arabidopsis mutants to observe the results these
   mutations had on the root architecture, protein presence, and gene
   expression. To do this, Salisbury et al. used GFP fluorescence along
   with other forms of both macro and microscopic imagery to observe any
   changes various mutations caused. From these research, Salisbury et al.
   were able to theorize that shoot located phytochromes alter auxin
   levels in roots, controlling lateral root development and overall root
   architecture.^[324][26] In the experiments of van Gelderen et al.
   (2018), they wanted to see if and how it is that the shoot of
   A. thaliana alters and affects root development and root architecture.
   To do this, they took Arabidopsis plants, grew them in [325]agar gel,
   and exposed the roots and shoots to separate sources of light. From
   here, they altered the different wavelengths of light the shoot and
   root of the plants were receiving and recorded the lateral root
   density, amount of lateral roots, and the general architecture of the
   lateral roots. To identify the function of specific photoreceptors,
   proteins, genes, and hormones, they utilized various Arabidopsis
   knockout mutants and observed the resulting changes in lateral roots
   architecture. Through their observations and various experiments, van
   Gelderen et al. were able to develop a mechanism for how root detection
   of Red to Far-red light ratios alter lateral root
   development.^[326][27]

   A true root system consists of a primary root and secondary roots (or
   [334]lateral roots).
     * the diffuse root system: the primary root is not dominant; the
       whole root system is fibrous and branches in all directions. Most
       common in [335]monocots. The main function of the fibrous root is
       to anchor the plant.

   The roots, or parts of roots, of many plant species have become
   specialized to serve adaptive purposes besides the two primary
   functions^[[347]clarification needed], described in the introduction.
     * Adventitious roots arise out-of-sequence from the more usual root
       formation of branches of a primary root, and instead originate from
       the stem, branches, leaves, or old woody roots. They commonly occur
       in [348]monocots and pteridophytes, but also in many [349]dicots,
       such as [350]clover (Trifolium), [351]ivy (Hedera), [352]strawberry
       (Fragaria) and [353]willow (Salix). Most aerial roots and stilt
       roots are adventitious. In some conifers adventitious roots can
       form the largest part of the root system. Adventitious root
       formation is enhanced in many plant species during (partial)
       submergence, to increase gas exchange and storage of gases like
       oxygen.^[354][28] Distinct types of adventitious roots can be
       classified and are dependent on morphology, growth dynamics and
       function.^[355][29]^[356][30]
     * Aerating roots (or knee root or knee or pneumatophores): roots
       rising above the ground, especially above water such as in some
       [357]mangrove genera ([358]Avicennia, [359]Sonneratia). In some
       plants like Avicennia the erect roots have a large number of
       breathing pores for exchange of gases.
     * [360]Aerial roots: roots entirely above the ground, such as in ivy
       (Hedera) or in [361]epiphytic [362]orchids. Many aerial roots are
       used to receive water and nutrient intake directly from the air -
       from fogs, dew or humidity in the air.^[363][31] Some rely on leaf
       systems to gather rain or humidity and even store it in scales or
       pockets. Other aerial roots, such as [364]mangrove aerial roots,
       are used for aeration and not for water absorption. Other aerial
       roots are used mainly for structure, functioning as prop roots, as
       in [365]maize or anchor roots or as the trunk in [366]strangler
       fig. In some Epiphytes - plants living above the surface on other
       plants, aerial roots serve for reaching to water sources or
       reaching the surface, and then functioning as regular surface
       roots.^[367][31]
     * [368]Canopy roots/arboreal roots: roots that form when tree
       branches support mats of epiphytes and detritus, which hold water
       and nutrients in the canopy. They grow out into these mats, likely
       to utilize the available nutrients and moisture.^[369][32]
     * Coarse roots: roots that have undergone secondary thickening and
       have a woody structure. These roots have some ability to absorb
       water and nutrients, but their main function is transport and to
       provide a structure to connect the smaller diameter, fine roots to
       the rest of the plant.
     * Contractile roots: roots that pull bulbs or corms of [370]monocots,
       such as [371]hyacinth and [372]lily, and some [373]taproots, such
       as [374]dandelion, deeper in the soil through expanding radially
       and contracting longitudinally. They have a wrinkled
       surface.^[375][33]
     * Coralloid roots: similar to root nodules, these provide nitrogen to
       the plant. They are often larger than nodules, branched, and
       located at or near the soil surface, and harbor nitrogen-fixing
       [376]cyanobacteria. They are only found in [377]cycads.
     * [378]Dimorphic root systems: roots with two distinctive forms for
       two separate functions
     * [379]Fine roots: typically primary roots <2 mm diameter that have
       the function of water and nutrient uptake. They are often heavily
       branched and support mycorrhizas. These roots may be short lived,
       but are replaced by the plant in an ongoing process of root
       'turnover'.
     * Haustorial roots: roots of parasitic plants that can absorb water
       and nutrients from another plant, such as in [380]mistletoe (Viscum
       album) and [381]dodder.
     * Propagative roots: roots that form adventitious buds that develop
       into aboveground shoots, termed [382]suckers, which form new
       plants, as in [383]common milkweed (Asclepias syriaca), [384]Canada
       thistle (Cirsium arvense), and many others.^[385][34]
     * Photosynthetic roots: roots that are green and photosynthesize,
       providing sugar to the plant. They are similar to
       [386]phylloclades. Several orchids have these, such as
       [387]Dendrophylax and [388]Taeniophyllum.
     * [389]Proteoid roots or cluster roots: dense clusters of rootlets of
       limited growth that develop under low [390]phosphate or low
       [391]iron conditions in [392]Proteaceae and some plants from the
--
       [395]Elaeagnaceae, [396]Moraceae, [397]Fabaceae and
       [398]Myricaceae.
     * [399]Root nodules: roots that harbor nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria.
       These are often very short and rounded. Root nodules are found in
       virtually all [400]legumes.
     * Stilt roots: adventitious support roots, common among
       [401]mangroves. They grow down from lateral branches, branching in
       the soil.
     * Storage roots: roots modified for storage of food or water, such as
       [402]carrots and [403]beets. They include some [404]taproots and
       tuberous roots.
     * Structural roots: large roots that have undergone considerable
       secondary thickening and provide mechanical support to woody plants
       and trees.
     * Surface roots: roots that proliferate close below the soil surface,
       exploiting water and easily available nutrients. Where conditions
       are close to optimum in the surface layers of soil, the growth of
       surface roots is encouraged and they commonly become the dominant
       roots.
     * Tuberous roots: fleshy and enlarged lateral roots for food or water
       storage, e.g. [405]sweet potato. A type of storage root distinct
       from taproot.

   The distribution of vascular plant roots within soil depends on plant
   form, the spatial and temporal availability of water and nutrients, and
   the physical properties of the soil. The deepest roots are generally
   found in deserts and temperate coniferous forests; the shallowest in
   tundra, boreal forest and temperate grasslands. The deepest observed
   living root, at least 60 metres (200 ft) below the ground surface, was
   observed during the excavation of an open-pit mine in Arizona, US. Some
   roots can grow as deep as the tree is high. The majority of roots on
   most plants are however found relatively close to the surface where
   nutrient availability and aeration are more favourable for growth.
   Rooting depth may be physically restricted by rock or compacted soil
   close below the surface, or by anaerobic soil conditions.

   Further information: [421]Evolution of plants § Evolution of roots

   The fossil record of roots--or rather, infilled voids where roots
   rotted after death--spans back to the late [422]Silurian, about
   430 million years ago.^[423][37] Their identification is difficult,
   because casts and molds of roots are so similar in appearance to animal
   burrows. They can be discriminated using a range of features.^[424][38]
   The evolutionary development of roots likely happened from the
   modification of shallow [425]rhizomes (modified horizontal stems) which
   anchored primitive vascular plants combined with the development of

   Light has been shown to have some impact on roots, but its not been
   studied as much as the effect of light on other plant systems. Early
   research in the 1930s found that light decreased the effectiveness of
   [431]Indole-3-acetic acid on adventitious root initiation. Studies of
   the pea in the 1950s shows that lateral root formation was inhibited by
   light, and in the early 1960s researchers found that light could induce
   positive [432]gravitropic responses in some situations. The effects of
   light on root elongation has been studied for [433]monocotyledonous and
   [434]dicotyledonous plants, with the majority of studies finding that
   light inhibited root elongation, whether pulsed or continuous. Studies
   of [435]Arabidopsis in the 1990s showed negative [436]phototropism and
   inhibition of the elongation of root hairs in light sensed by
   [437]phyB.^[438][40]

   Certain plants, namely [439]Fabaceae, form [440]root nodules in order
   to associate and form a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing
   bacteria called [441]rhizobia. Owing to the high energy required to fix
--
   compounds produced from ammonia by the bacteria.^[442][41]

   Soil temperature is a factor that effects [443]root initiation and
   length. Root length is usually impacted more dramatically by
   temperature than overall mass, where cooler temperatures tend to cause
   more lateral growth because downward extension is limited by cooler
   temperatures at subsoil levels. Needs vary by plant species, but in
   temperate regions cool temperatures may limit root systems. Cool
   temperature species like [444]oats, [445]rapeseed, [446]rye, [447]wheat
   fare better in lower temperatures than summer [448]annuals like
   [449]maize and [450]cotton. Researchers have found that plants like
   cotton develop wider and shorter [451]taproots in cooler temperatures.
   The first root originating from the seed usually has a wider diameter
   than root branches, so smaller root diameters are expected if
   temperatures increase root initiation. Root diameter also decreases
   when the root elongates.^[452][42]

Plant interactions

   Plants can interact with one another in their environment through their
   root systems. Studies have demonstrated that plant-plant interaction
   occurs among root systems via the soil as a medium. Researchers have
   tested whether plants growing in ambient conditions would change their
   behavior if a nearby plant was exposed to drought conditions.^[454][43]
   Since nearby plants showed no changes in [455]stomatal aperture
   researchers believe the drought signal spread through the roots and
   soil, not through the air as a volatile chemical signal.^[456][44]

   Soil microbiota can suppress both disease and beneficial root symbionts
   (mycorrhizal fungi are easier to establish in sterile soil).
   Inoculation with soil bacteria can increase internode extension, yield
   and quicken flowering. The migration of bacteria along the root varies
   with natural soil conditions. For example, research has found that the
   root systems of wheat seeds inoculated with [458]Azotobacter showed
   higher populations in soils favorable to Azotobacter growth. Some
   studies have been unsuccessful in increasing the levels of certain

   sterilization.^[460][45]

   Grass root systems are beneficial at reducing [461]soil erosion by
   holding the soil together. [462]Perennial grasses that grow wild in
   rangelands contribute organic matter to the soil when their old roots
   decay after attacks by beneficial [463]fungi, [464]protozoa, bacteria,
   insects and worms release nutrients.^[465][5]

   Scientists have observed significant diversity of the microbial cover
   of roots at around 10 percent of three week old root segments covered.
   On younger roots there was even low coverage, but even on 3-month-old
   roots the coverage was only around 37%. Before the 1970s, scientists
   believed that the majority of the root surface was covered by
   microorganisms.^[466][5]

   Researchers studying [468]maize seedlings found that calcium absorption
   was greatest in the [469]apical root segment, and potassium at the base
   of the root. Along other root segments absorption was similar. Absorbed
   potassium is transported to the root tip, and to a lesser extent other
   parts of the root, then also to the shoot and grain. Calcium transport
   from the apical segment is slower, mostly transported upward and
   accumulated in stem and shoot.^[470][46]

   would be expected to have negative impacts for integrity of the plant
   [475]membrane, that could effect some properties like its permeability,
   and is needed for the [476]ion uptake activity of the root
   membranes.^[477][47]

   [479][220px-Roots_and_Soil_Erosion.jpg] Roots can also protect the
   environment by holding the soil to reduce soil
   erosion.[480][220px-World_Primary_Crops_Harvested_Area_By_Commodity_Gro
   up.svg.png] Roots and tubers are some of the most widely harvested
   crops in the world.

   The term [481]root crops refers to any edible underground plant
   structure, but many root crops are actually stems, such as [482]potato
   tubers. Edible roots include [483]cassava, [484]sweet potato,
   [485]beet, [486]carrot, [487]rutabaga, [488]turnip, [489]parsnip,
   [490]radish, [491]yam and [492]horseradish. Spices obtained from roots
   include [493]sassafras, [494]angelica, [495]sarsaparilla and
   [496]licorice.

   [497]Sugar beet is an important source of sugar. [498]Yam roots are a
   source of [499]estrogen compounds used in [500]birth control pills. The
   fish [501]poison and [502]insecticide [503]rotenone is obtained from
   roots of [504]Lonchocarpus spp. Important medicines from roots are
   [505]ginseng, [506]aconite, [507]ipecac, [508]gentian and
   [509]reserpine. Several legumes that have nitrogen-fixing root nodules
   are used as green manure crops, which provide nitrogen fertilizer for
   other crops when plowed under. Specialized [510]bald cypress roots,
   termed knees, are sold as souvenirs, lamp bases and carved into folk
   art. [511]Native Americans used the flexible roots of [512]white spruce
   for basketry.

   [513]Tree roots can heave and destroy [514]concrete sidewalks and crush
   or clog buried pipes.^[515][48] The aerial roots of [516]strangler fig
   have damaged ancient [517]Mayan [518]temples in [519]Central America
   and the temple of [520]Angkor Wat in [521]Cambodia.

   Trees stabilize soil on a slope prone to [522]landslides. The [523]root
   hairs work as an anchor on the soil.

   [524]Vegetative propagation of plants via cuttings depends on
   adventitious root formation. Hundreds of millions of plants are
   propagated via [525]cuttings annually including [526]chrysanthemum,
   [527]poinsettia, [528]carnation, ornamental [529]shrubs and many
   [530]houseplants.

   Roots can also protect the environment by holding the soil to reduce
   soil erosion. This is especially important in areas such as [531]sand
   dunes.
