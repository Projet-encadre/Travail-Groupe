   filesystem hierarchy

   In the FHS, all files and [95]directories appear under the [96]root
   directory /, even if they are stored on different physical or virtual
   devices. Some of these directories only exist in a particular system if

   authoritative for platforms other than Linux.
   Directory Description

   [139]procfs mount. Generally, automatically generated and populated by
