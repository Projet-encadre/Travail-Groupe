RootsWeb

   [[299]edit]

   RootsWeb, acquired by Ancestry in June 2000, is a free genealogy
   community that uses online forums, mailing lists, and other resources
   to help people research their family history. Users can upload
   [300]GEDCOM files of their information for others to search at the
   WorldConnect portion of the site. Trees uploaded to WorldConnect are
   searchable at both the RootsWeb and Ancestry Web sites.

   On December 20, 2017, a file containing 300,000 RootsWeb user names,
   passwords, and email addresses was exposed to the Internet. The 300,000
   records were from RootsWeb surname list service; 55,000 of those
   records were also Ancestry.com login credentials.^[301][81] By 2024,
   the hosted Web sites were all read-only, disabling all user logins.
